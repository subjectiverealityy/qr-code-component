# Frontend Mentor - QR code component solution

This is a solution to the [QR code component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/qr-code-component-iux_sIO_H). Frontend Mentor challenges were made to help frontend developers like me improve my coding skills by building realistic projects. 

Built with HTML and CSS (Flexbox was used). A Figma file was used.
